# 📱 PHONE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE

## System Design Decision

This system is designed as **PHONE-FIRST with WhatsApp-only communication**. Email functionality has been completely removed by design.

## ✅ What We Use

### Primary Communication Channel: WhatsApp
- **User Registration**: Phone number + WhatsApp OTP
- **Login**: Phone/Username + Password
- **Password Reset**: WhatsApp OTP
- **Notifications**: All via WhatsApp
- **Customer Support**: WhatsApp Bot
- **Technician Commands**: WhatsApp Bot

### User Identification
- **Primary ID**: Phone number (required)
- **Secondary ID**: Username (optional)
- **WhatsApp JID**: Auto-linked from phone

## ❌ What We DON'T Use

### No Email Support
- No SMTP configuration
- No email sending
- No email verification
- No email templates
- No newsletter subscriptions
- No email notifications

## 🚫 DO NOT Add These Features

1. **Email Registration/Login**
2. **Email Verification**
3. **Email Password Reset**
4. **Email Notifications**
5. **Newsletter Subscriptions**
6. **Email Templates**
7. **SMTP Configuration**
8. **Email Service Providers (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)**

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- No email-based recovery

### Data Privacy
- Phone numbers are encrypted in database
- WhatsApp sessions are secured
- No email data stored or transmitted

## 📝 Code Standards

### When Adding New Features
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Phone-first approach
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    phone: phoneNumber,
    whatsappNumber: phoneNumber,
    name: userName,
    password: hashedPassword
  }
});

// ❌ WRONG - Never add email
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: userEmail,  // DON'T DO THIS
    phone: phoneNumber,
    // ...
  }
});
```

### Form Validation
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Phone validation
const schema = z.object({
  phone: phoneSchema,
  password: passwordSchema
});

// ❌ WRONG - No email validation
const schema = z.object({
  email: emailSchema,  // DON'T ADD THIS
  phone: phoneSchema,
  password: passwordSchema
});
```
